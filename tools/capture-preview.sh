# Capture the popup, one PNG per tab, for the marketplace listing assets.
#
# Two things make this awkward to do by hand:
#
#   * Clicking a terminal closes the popup, so it has to be driven over IPC
#     (`omarchy-shell shell summon`) rather than opened with the mouse.
#   * The popup is drawn inside a *fullscreen* layer surface, so the compositor
#     cannot tell anyone where it actually is — `hyprctl layers` reports the
#     whole screen.
#
# The second one has an exact answer: ask the panel. With `debugGeometry` on it
# prints its own frame on open, in screen coordinates, once the layout has
# settled. We read that back out of the journal and hand it straight to grim.
#
# The obvious alternative — shooting the screen with the popup open and closed
# and diffing — is a heuristic that loses to anything else that moves: an
# animated wallpaper, a playing video, a blinking cursor. Don't go back to it.
#
# Usage:  tools/capture-preview.sh [tab ...]      (default: all of them)
